# Navigation architecture component sample
Simple app for studying Navigation Architecture Components and Kotlin

### Sample App Includes
 * Splash Screen
 * Home Page with TabLayout
 * RecyclerView, using ListAdapter
 
### This project used followings :
 * [ListAdapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/recyclerview/extensions/ListAdapter) : Advantage of using ListAdapter is that it can handle recyclerview's changed item, updating only the changed instead of refreshing whole list, by passing custom DiffUtil
 * [Navigation Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) : Simplifies the implementation of navigation in an Android app, works similar as the Storyboard in iOS. I have used an Activity as an entry point of the app and set all fragments within the activity

### TODOs :
 * Try out RoomDB
 * Use single activity
